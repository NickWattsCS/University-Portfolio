# University-Portfolio
This repository serves as a collection of projects that I've done while completing my university's computer science program.

This readme will provide basic information about each project, wherein another separate README file will instruct
you how to compile and run each program. These projects are typically smaller in code, and not big enough for their own
repository. Projects that I have made in university with a larger scale are contained in their own repositories.
